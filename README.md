Contact Keeper App built with React

I followed a Udemy course while building this app in order to learn more advanced components of React. The back-end was built using
Node and Express, coupled with MongoDB + Mongoose for database handling and utilizing Mongo Atlas to host the database.
I was able to learn about user authentication and specific pages allowed access based on that by learning to use
auth tokens via JSONWebToken and BcryptJS. Learned how to use Axios to not only get and post data from and to the database but
also to manage the data to be handled back and forth between the back-end and the front-end. The front-end was built with
React functional components using hooks. Implemented React's Context API to handle state management among components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dev`

This works only in the root folder, runs the app front-end and back-end as well using
concurrently to run two scripts at once.
Back-end port uses localhost:5000 (or other if specified by user) and front-end on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
